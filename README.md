## Use of .gitignore file
The gitignore file in Visual Studio is used to guarantee that files monitored by Git stay untracked. To stop monitoring a currently tracked file so that credentials are protected and ignore its directories 

## Branching Strategy
Use the feature of branches from main branch and also for bug fixes.
Merge branches with main branch using pull requests keeping main branch up to date by dividing and conquering work

## Credentials and sensitive information 
To protect sensitive information certain repositories including projects, will be kept as private instead of public 
for certain repositories that are made public to other users they will jus be as a visible readable texts and non editable even if repositories are forked only certain users will be given access to certain things.
